#CPSC 473 - Web Programming & Data Management
###Project Base Template for Project 1

__Description:__ Social website to match people with similar interests.

__Status:__ Under construction

__Run:__

    $ node app.js

__Notes:__
- There is not a need for a "functionality document" because if a user can't figure out what a page does by looking at it, then you're not doing it right<br>
- Best used with Node 0.10.38 (latest version at the time of writing this)<br>
- Use port 2200, because apparently that's the port that is hardcoded in<br>
